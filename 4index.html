        <p>As we know 80% percent of the basin is covered with Amazon rainforest thus, it's clear that many tribal group
            also lived here it is estimated 400 or more than 400 tribal groups lived here from hundreds of year with
            their own culture, language, and lifestyle it is home to 1 million Indian tribe also. Today total population
            of Amazon basin is 1.5 million distributed and 400 tribal group .There are 100 uncontacted tribes. It is
            even said that few tribes even practice canbilsm which is a practice of eating human. The largest
            organization fighting for the indigenous peoples in this area is COICA. It is a supra organization
            encompassing all indigenous rights organizations working in the Amazon basin area, and covers the people
            living in several countries.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Amazonia is sparsely populated. There are scattered settlements inland, but most of the population lives in a
            few larger cities on the banks of the Amazon and other major rivers, such as in Iquitos - Loreto in Peru,
            Manaus-Amazonas State, and Belém, Pará. In many regions, the forest has been cleared for soya bean
            plantations and ranching (the most extensive non-forest use of the land); some of the inhabitants harvest
            wild rubber latex, and Brazilian nuts. This is a form of extractive farms, where the trees are not cut down.
            These are relatively sustainable operations in contrast to lumbering or agriculture dependent on clearing
            the rainforest. The people live in thatched houses shaped liked beehives. They also build apartment-like
            houses called "Maloca", with a steeply slanting roof.</p>
