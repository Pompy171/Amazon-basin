        <h1>Wildlife</h1>
        <p>More than 1,400 species of mammals are found in the Amazon, the majority of which are species of bats and
            rodents. Its larger mammals include the jaguar, ocelot, capybara, puma and South American tapir.</p>
        <br>
        <p>About 1500 bird species inhabit the Amazon basin. The biodiversity of the Amazon and the sheer number of
            diverse bird species is given by the number of different bird families that reside in these humid forests.
            An example of such would be the cotinga family, to which the Guianan cock-of-the-rock belong. Birds such as
            toucans, and hummingbirds are also found here. Macaws are famous for duck gathering by the hundreds along
            the clay cliffs of the Amazon River.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Plant growth is quite dense and its variety of animal inhabitants is comparatively high due to the heavy
            rainfall and the dense and extensive evergreen and coniferous forests. Little sunlight reaches the ground
            due to the dense roof canopy by plants. The ground remains dark and damp and only shade-tolerant vegetation
            will grow here. Orchids and bromeliads exploit trees and other plants to get closer to the sunlight.</p>
